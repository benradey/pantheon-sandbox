= Assembly for Xref Demo

This is intro text.

Also, here are some xrefs at the assembly level:

Path:
xref:chap2.adoc#[Assembly-level filepath xref to chapter 2]

Id:
xref:#chap2id_demo[Assembly-level id xref to chapter 2 body]

Both:
xref:chap2.adoc#chap2id_demo[Assembly-level path-and-id xref to chapter 2 body]

include::chap1.adoc[]

This is glue text.

include::chap2.adoc[]

And this is the end.
